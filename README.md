## Integrations

### Discord Webhook Notifications

Chessly can send automated notifications to a Discord channel when key events occur (e.g., when a tournament ends and a winner is determined).

To enable Discord notifications:

1. **Create a Discord webhook:**
   - Go to your Discord server settings ‚Üí Channel settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks.
   - Click "New Webhook", copy the webhook URL.

2. **Configure the webhook URL:**
   - Set your Discord webhook URL in the backend configuration's `.env`

3. **How it works:**
   - When a tournament ends, Chessly sends a message to the configured Discord channel announcing the winner.

**Example webhook payload:**
```json
{
  "content": "üèÜ Tournament 'Spring Open' has ended! Winner: Andrei (Score: 3.5/5)"
}
```
